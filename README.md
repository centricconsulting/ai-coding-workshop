# Workshop: Using AI for Application Development with GitHub Copilot (.NET Edition)

This repository contains materials for a 3-hour workshop. Participants will use **Visual Studio Code**, **.NET 9**, and **GitHub Copilot** to experience how AI can support application development with modern practices including Clean Architecture and OpenTelemetry observability.


## Prerequisites

## Using the Dev Container (Recommended)

For a fully pre-configured .NET 9 development environment, you can use the included **Dev Container**. This is the fastest way to get started and ensures all required tools and extensions are installed.

**How to use:**
1. Open this repository in VS Code.
2. Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`).
3. Select: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
4. VS Code will build and open the project in a container with .NET 9, GitHub CLI, Copilot, C# Dev Kit, and all required extensions.

_This is optional but highly recommended, especially if you want to avoid manual environment setup or ensure consistency across all participants._

Before attending this workshop, participants should have:

- **GitHub Copilot**: Active subscription and extension installed in VS Code
- **.NET 9 SDK**: Installed and verified with `dotnet --version`
- **Visual Studio Code**: Latest version with C# Dev Kit extension
- **Git**: Basic familiarity with git commands
- **C# Experience**: Comfortable with basic C# syntax and concepts
- **GitHub Account**: For cloning repositories and accessing Copilot

### Environment Check

Run these commands to verify your setup:

```bash
dotnet --version          # Should show 9.x.x
git --version            # Any recent version
code --version           # VS Code version
```

### Pre-Workshop Preparation

**Participants**: Please complete the [Pre-Workshop Environment Checklist](docs/PRE_WORKSHOP_CHECKLIST.md) **before** attending the workshop to ensure your environment is fully configured. This will allow us to maximize hands-on learning time.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

- **Leverage repository-level Copilot Instructions** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) for team-wide consistent code generation
- **Transform requirements** into backlog items, acceptance criteria, and working code using AI assistance
- **Generate and refactor .NET code** following Clean Architecture and DDD principles
- **Create comprehensive tests** and documentation with AI support
- **Apply conventional commits** and generate professional PR descriptions
- **Identify anti-patterns** and best practices when working with AI coding assistants

## Schedule

### 0. Kickoff & Setup (15 min)

- Goals and environment check
- Clone the repository and create your own branch from `main` before starting the labs
- Copilot instructions automatically configured via `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### 0.5. GitHub Copilot Features Tour (15 min)

- Inline completions, Chat panel, and Inline Chat
- Slash commands: `/explain`, `/fix`, `/tests`, `/doc`, `/refactor`
- Chat participants: `@workspace`, `@vscode`, `@terminal`
- Context variables: `#file`, `#selection`, `#editor`
- Quick hands-on practice with each feature

### 1. Controlling Context with Copilot Instructions (30 min)

- Understand repository-level Copilot Instructions (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- **Emphasis on TDD workflow**: Write tests before implementation
- Lab 1: Create NotificationService following Red-Green-Refactor cycle (interface ‚Üí tests ‚Üí implementation)

### 2. Requirements ‚Üí Backlog ‚Üí Code (45 min)

- Turn requirements into backlog items, tests, and code
- Lab 2: Backlog items ‚Üí acceptance criteria ‚Üí TaskService.AddTask

### 3. Code Generation & Refactoring (45 min)

- Scaffold APIs, refactor legacy methods with slash commands
- Lab 3: Minimal API with `@workspace`, refactor with `/refactor`, generate tests with `/tests`

### 4. Testing, Documentation, Workflow (15 min)

- Generate tests, docs, commit/PR messages using Copilot features
- Lab 4: `/tests` for unit tests, `/doc` for documentation, conventional commits

### 5. Wrap-Up & Discussion (15 min)

- Lessons learned
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Next steps and Q&A

Each lab includes:

- ‚úÖ Clear learning objectives and prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step instructions with prompts
- ‚úÖ Expected code outputs and examples
- ‚úÖ Troubleshooting guidance
- ‚úÖ Extension exercises for advanced participants
- ‚úÖ Success criteria checklist


### Starter Solution Structure

The `main` branch contains:
- **Complete Solution**: Clean Architecture with Domain/Application/Infrastructure/API layers
- **Console Application**: .NET 9 console app with DI and logging for initial exercises
- **Web API**: Minimal API with extension methods and OpenTelemetry integration
- **Legacy Code Sample**: `LegacyTaskProcessor` for refactoring exercises

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/centricconsulting/ai-coding-workshop.git
   cd ai-coding-workshop
   ```


2. **Create your own branch from `main`**:

   ```bash
   dotnet --version    # Should show 9.x.x or later
   dotnet build        # Verify solution builds
   dotnet test         # Verify tests run
