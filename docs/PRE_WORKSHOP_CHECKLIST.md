- **Windows**: Add to PATH during installation
- **Linux**: Follow distribution-specific instructions

---

### 3. VS Code Extensions

Install these required extensions:

- [ ] **GitHub Copilot** (GitHub.copilot)
  1. Open VS Code
  2. Click Extensions icon (left sidebar) or press `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+X`
  3. Search for "GitHub Copilot"
  4. Click "Install"
  5. Sign in with your GitHub account when prompted

  - Search for "GitHub Copilot Chat"
  - Click "Install"
  
- [ ] **C# Dev Kit** (ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)
  - Search for "C# Dev Kit"
  - Click "Install"
  - Includes C# language support, IntelliSense, and debugging

**Verify extensions installed:**
1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Type "Extensions: Show Installed Extensions"
3. Confirm all three are listed

**Verify Copilot is working:**
1. Create a new file: `test.cs`
2. Type: `// Function to calculate fibonacci`
3. Press Enter - you should see gray "ghost text" suggestions
4. Press Tab to accept or Esc to dismiss
5. âœ… If you see suggestions, Copilot is working!

---

### 4. .NET 9 SDK Installation

- [ ] **.NET 9 SDK installed**
  - Download: [dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
  - Choose ".NET 9 SDK" (not Runtime)
  - Run installer for your platform

- [ ] **Verify installation**
  
Run in terminal:
```bash
dotnet --version
```

Expected output:
```
9.0.x (any 9.x.x version is fine)
```

**Common issues:**
- **Command not found**: Restart terminal or reboot computer
- **Old version showing**: Uninstall old versions, reinstall .NET 9, restart terminal
- **Multiple versions**: That's OK! The workshop uses .NET 9, but having 6/7/8 won't hurt

---

### 5. Git Installation & Configuration

- [ ] **Git installed**
  - macOS: Install via [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  - Windows: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
  - Linux: Use package manager (`apt`, `yum`, `dnf`)

- [ ] **Verify Git version**

```bash
git --version
```

Expected: `git version 2.30` or later

- [ ] **Configure Git identity** (if not already done)

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

- [ ] **Verify configuration**

```bash
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

Should display your name and email.

---

### 6. Clone Workshop Repository

- [ ] **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/centricconsulting/ai-coding-workshop.git
cd ai-coding-workshop
```

- [ ] **Checkout starter-projects branch**

```bash
git checkout starter-projects
```

Expected output:
```
Switched to branch 'starter-projects'
```

- [ ] **Open in VS Code**

```bash
code .
```

VS Code should open with the workshop repository.

---

### 7. Verify Solution Builds

- [ ] **Restore dependencies**

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Expected: "Restore succeeded" with no errors

- [ ] **Build solution**

```bash
dotnet build
```

Expected output:
```
Build succeeded in X.Xs
TaskManager.Domain succeeded
TaskManager.Application succeeded
TaskManager.Infrastructure succeeded
TaskManager.Api succeeded
TaskManager.ConsoleApp succeeded
TaskManager.UnitTests succeeded
TaskManager.IntegrationTests succeeded
```

- [ ] **Run tests** (should have failures - this is expected!)

```bash
dotnet test
```

Expected output:
```
Test summary: total: 11, failed: 11, succeeded: 0
```

âœ… **This is correct!** The 11 failing tests are placeholders you'll implement during the workshop.

**Build issues?**
- Run `dotnet clean` then try again
- Check .NET version is 9.x
- Ensure all extensions are installed

### 8. Verify GitHub Copilot Integration

- [ ] **Open a C# file**

- [ ] **Test inline suggestions**
  1. At the end of the file, add a new line
  2. Type: `// Method to validate task title`
  3. Press Enter
  4. Start typing: `public static bool`
  5. You should see gray "ghost text" completing the method
  6. Press Tab to accept or Esc to dismiss
  7. Delete the test code

- [ ] **Test Copilot Chat**
  1. Open Copilot Chat: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+I` (or click chat icon in left sidebar)
  2. Type: `What testing frameworks are used in this project?`
  3. Press Enter
  4. Should get a response mentioning xUnit and FakeItEasy

## ðŸ†˜ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "GitHub Copilot is not available"

3. Check Copilot isn't disabled for the file type
4. Try closing and reopening the file
5. Check Copilot status bar icon isn't showing error

### Issue: Extensions not loading

**Solution:**
1. Ensure VS Code is up to date (Help â†’ Check for Updates)
2. Disable other AI/autocomplete extensions that might conflict
3. Reload window: Command Palette â†’ "Developer: Reload Window"
4. Reinstall extensions if needed

### Issue: Git clone fails

**Solution:**
1. Check internet connection
